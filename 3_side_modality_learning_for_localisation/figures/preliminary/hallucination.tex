	\caption[Hallucination network for image descriptors learning]{\label{fig:hall_method} \textbf{Hallucination network for image descriptors learning:} we train an hallucination network, inspired from~\cite{Hoffman2016}, for the task of global image description. Unlike the proposed method (see figure~\ref{fig:our_method}), hallucination network reproduces feature maps that would have been obtained by a network trained with depth map rather than the deep map itself.}
