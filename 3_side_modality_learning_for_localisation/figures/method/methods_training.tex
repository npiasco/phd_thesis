These features are used to create intermediate descriptors that are finally concatenated in one final image descriptor.}

Unlike the proposed method (see figure~\ref{fig:our_method}), hallucination network reproduces feature maps that would have been obtained by a network trained with depth map rather than the deep map itself.}
