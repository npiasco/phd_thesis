\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have introduced a new competitive global image descriptor designed for image-based localization under challenging conditions. Our descriptor handle visual changes between images by learning the geometry of the scene. Strength of our method remains in the fact that it needs geometric information only during the learning procedure. Our trained descriptor is then used on images only. Experiments show that our proposal is much more efficient than state-of-the-art localization methods~\cite{Arandjelovic2017, Radenovic2017}, including methods based on side information learning~\cite{Hoffman2016}. Our descriptor performs especially well for challenging cross-season localization scenario, therefore it can be used to solve long-term place recognition problem. We additionally obtain encouraging results for night to day image retrieval. Finally we show that our method can generalize to over auxiliary modality supervision during training. We use lidar reflectance to illustrate this generalization capability.

In a future work we will go deeper on the use of other modalities as side information sources, like semantic~\cite{Seymour2018}, and focusing on multi-modal fusion. We also want to study the generalization capability of our system, by considering a different image-based localization task like direct pose regression~\cite{Brachmann2017b}.
