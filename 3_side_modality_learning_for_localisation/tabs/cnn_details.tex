Abbreviations present in the table refer to: Regions of Interest (ROI), Landmark Distribution Descriptors (LDD), Maximum Activations of Convolutions (MAC), Regional MAC (R-MAC), Contextual Reweighting Network (CRN). $^\dagger$~Specify if the network is feeded with the whole image or with fragments. $^\ddagger$~Aggregation method within the \ac{cnn} architecture. $^*$~Off-the-shelf means that the network was initially trained for scene classification~\citep{Krizhevsky2012} or over computer vision tasks.}
