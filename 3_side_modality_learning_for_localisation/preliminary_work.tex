We compare our method of side information learning with a state-of-the-art approach system, named hallucination network~\cite{Hoffman2016}. The hallucination network is originally designed for object detection and classification in images. We adapt the work of~\cite{Hoffman2016} to create an image descriptor system that benefits from depth map side modality during training. Like our proposal, the trained hallucination network is used on images only and produces a global descriptor for image localization. The system is presented in figure~\ref{fig:hall_method}. The main difference with our proposal is that the hallucination network reproduces feature maps that would have been obtained by a network trained with depth map rather than the depth map itself. We refer readers to~\cite{Hoffman2016} for more information about the hallucination network.
