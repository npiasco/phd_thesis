\section{Thesis outlines}
This thesis presents an original research work on the development of a new \ac{vbl} method taking benefit from heterogeneous data. An exhaustive review of existing \ac{vbl} methods is presented in \acl{chp}~\ref{chap:2}, with a special attention paid to data heterogeneity within these methods. \Ac{chp}~\ref{chap:3} presents our learned global image descriptor augmented with auxiliary modalities and designed for the task of \ac{vbl} in challenging conditions. In \acl{chp}~\ref{chap:4}, we introduce a original image pose refinement step which uses missing geometric information to improve localization performances over our first method. Finally, \ac{chp}~\ref{chap:5} concludes the thesis and offers avenues for prospective work.
