\section{Network architectures}
\label{apx:archi}

We denote the fully convolutional architecture as \textbf{FC} and convolutional layers + recurrent layers architecture as \textbf{C+LSTM}. FC and C+LSTM encoders are identical, with 6.3M parameters, FC decoder has 16.7M parameters and C+LSTM decoder has 10.1M parameters.
