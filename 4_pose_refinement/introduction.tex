Many applications in Computer Vision and Robotics require an initial pose estimation of the visual data acquisition system: augmented reality~\citep{Arth2015}, visual odometry~\citep{Pascoe2015a}, SLAM~\citep{Milford2012} or visual servoing~\citep{Marchand2016}, to name a few. Coarse estimation provided from standard geo-localization system (\textit{e.g.} GPS) are not accurate enough for such applications, and other processing are required to initialize the system with a suitable pose. As our second principal contribution in this thesis is a pose refinement method, we save up the presentation of such methods for chapter~\ref{chap:4}.
