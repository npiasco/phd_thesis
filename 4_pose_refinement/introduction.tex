Many applications in Computer Vision and Robotics require a precise initial pose estimation of the visual data acquisition system: augmented reality~\citep{Arth2015}, visual odometry~\citep{Pascoe2015a}, SLAM~\citep{Milford2012} or visual servoing~\citep{Marchand2016}, to name a few. Coarse estimation provided from standard geo-localization system (\textit{e.g.} GPS) or \ac{cbir} for localization are not accurate enough for such applications, and other processing are required to initialize the system with a suitable pose. For instance, considering a system using pose initialization by \ac{cbir}, the reference database is never dense enough to ensure that it exist an example within this database at exactly the same pose as the query. Thus, the exact 6-\ac{dof} of the query cannot be recovered.

We introduce in the previous chapter a global image descriptor for localization under challenging condition. We are now considering the problem of pose refinement, in over word the second step of our hierarchical \ac{vbl} system. In section~\ref{subsec:pose_refinement}, we mentioned two main approaches for pose refinement: image-based and model based. As our first localization step rely on image indexing, an image-based refinement method is more logical to implement. We also want to take advantage of the depth maps produced by our descriptor (see section~\ref{sec:preliminary_work}).



The rest of this chapter is presented as follows: the next section is dedicated to a brief review of the related work, then the details of our method are presented in section~\ref{sec:method}. The obtained results with our proposal are discussed in section~\ref{seq:results}, and we finally conclude the paper in section~\ref{seq:conclusion}.
