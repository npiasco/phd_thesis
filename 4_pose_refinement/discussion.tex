\section{Discussion}
The final camera pose precision is highly dependent on the images returned by the \ac{cbir} initial step. Thus, our method performances are limited by the quality of the global image descriptor. Wrong initial pose estimation for stairs indoor scene and street outdoor environment cannot be recovered by \ac{pnlp} pose refinement. It will be interesting to consider more discriminative image descriptors, and especially image descriptors that can benefit from the depth map related to the image like the one presented in previous chapter~\ref{chap:3}.

The pose refinement is also very sensitive to the quality of the generated depth map. Artifacts present on depth map related to images of unknown scenes or wrong reconstruction, see last 4 columns of figure~\ref{fig:depth_map_indoor}, generate outliers for the \ac{pnlp} optimization. This first work can be view as a proof of concept where we use very limited data for training our model. We can expect better results if we take advantages of bigger dataset, such as Megadepth dataset introduced in~\citep{}.
