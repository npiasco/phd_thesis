\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion_pnlp}

We have introduced a new method for \ac{vbl} consisting of an initial pose estimation by \ac{cbir} followed by a new relative pose estimation method. \ac{pnlp} relies on densely matched 2D to 3D points between the query and the reference images, where the 3D points are project thank to the reconstructed depth map from a monocular image. The presented method is compact and fast as all the components needed by the localization pipeline are computed thanks to the same neural network in a single forward pass. Because our network learns the depth relative to the camera frame, not the absolute geometric structure of the scene, it can be used in unknown environment without fine tuning or specific training.
