\section{Scientific contributions}

In the following, we summarize the major scientific contributions made during this thesis along with the corresponding publications:

\begin{description}
	\item[Detailed review of \ac{vbl} method:] in this journal paper~\citep{Piasco2017}, we present a large panorama of image base localization methods. We propose a simple two-categories methods classification a we highlight common processing within the different \ac{vbl} approaches. We also reserve two main sections for describing challenges in localization and to present the different type data engaged in the localization process.
	\item[Side modality trained global image descriptor:] in this initial work~\citep{Piasco2019} we introduce our new global image descriptor for \ac{vbl} trained with side geometric information. In the following paper~\citep{Piasco2019c}, we extend our previous work with more experiments and with the use of a novel modality as side information during the training process.
	\item[Relative pose estimation from learned depth maps:] we present our first version of pose refinement with learned depth map in~\citep{Piasco2019a}. Subsequent publication~\citep{Piasco2019b} improves the accuracy of the method and propose outdoor localization experiments.
